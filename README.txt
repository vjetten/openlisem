version 4.91 (180119)
- fixed a bug in the screen output causing negative values of discharge and a large mass balance error. 
  Note: when you select dynamic wave flow, the flood height in mm reported is not part of the mass balance, as it is already 
  included in overland flow.

version 3.99-4.9 (180116)
- added dynamic wave for overland flow, three numerical solutions now: kinematic (using LDD), diffusive and dynamic (using DEM). 
- Flooding is always solved with a dynamic wave, channel flow is always kinematic.

- BugFix: Calibration factor for Cohesion and Aggregate stability (they were reversed)
- BugFix: in Channel Cohesion, soil sohesion was used instead of channel cohesion
- BugFix: cleaned up litter interception, roof interception and effect of raindrums 
- BugFix: ensures that screen information, file and map output is all the same
- Added: Fixed bilinear interpolation for sediment, other options give mass balance errors
- Added: EXPERIMENTAL: an empirical factor (1-99) to increase the flow in the direction of the steepest resistance slope for diffuse overland flow. 
- Added: calibration factor for channel cohesion
- Added: if the cohesion of slopes or channels is negative, the detachment is assumed to be zero. Deposition will take place
- Added: total interception (roofs, canopy, litter, randrums) to the screen output (in mm)
- Added: the possibility to write GeoTIFF files for the main map outptu. GTiff is not georeferenced). Tif input is also automatically possible (experimental)

- Added GeoTiff writing for main output maps (not timeseries)
- Added 3 missing fluxes (in mm) to report with totals

Version 2.03-3.94 (170212)
================================================================================================================================================
The following features are inplemented in the course of 2015 and 2016:

- Multiple catchments can be done in one simulation (limited by PC memory)
- Spatial rainfall from rainfall maps (e.g. model results or satellite images)
- 1D kinematic wave for runoff and channels based on a usr defined network
- Diffusive wave 2D runoff, uses the DEM directly (does not use the LDD which is reserved for the Kinematic wave)
- Dynamic wave shallow flooding, based on the FULLSWOF project: https://www.univ-orleans.fr/mapmo/soft/FullSWOF/
- Sediment dynamics (erosion, transport, deposition) for splash, runoff, channel flow and flooding
- Flow barriers (walls) can be defined to close areas in 1-4 directions, e.g. as flood protection walls of a given hieght
- Channels can be wider than a gridcell
- Channel stationary baseflow can be added
- Sediment transport for suspended matter only, suspended matter and bedload movement, choice from different transport equations
- Sediment transport for a median grainsize class or multiple classes (based on D50-D90 or user defined)
- All fluxes are made visible as maps on screen while running, and saved to files
- Hydrographs and sedigraphs from multiple observation points and outlets can be shown onscreen while running, and saved to files

Because of diffusive runoff the range of resolutions can now be larger, LISEM is being tested from 1 cm gridcells (2 m2) to 20m gridcells (600 km2)


1) The openLISEM model 
======================

This is the event based spatial runoff and erosion model openLISEM. Thank you 
for downloading. openLISEM simulates the spatial dynamics of surface runoff and 
erosion for catchments of 1 ha to 500 km2. It is based on the LISEM model that 
is available here: www.itc.nl/lisem. Details about the theory and dataset for 
now can be found on this website (although a bit outdated). openLISEM uses the 
freeware GIS PCRaster (http://pcraster.geo.uu.nl) for database creation and 
analysis of the results. 

2) Terms of use
