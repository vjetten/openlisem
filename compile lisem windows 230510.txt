openLISEM: Quick guideline for code development
===============================================
Date: 230501

Introduction:
openLISEM is compiled with MINGW64, the windows port of the native Linux compiler. The advantage is that it is opensource and free, and easy to compile lisem under Linux.
It is developed in the Qt environment for the interface and extension of C++ libs

> The following software is needed
- MSYS is the installation environment used for MINGW64 and all libraries needed, such as Qt.
- Qt is the development environment for the code (installed by MSYS)
- QWT is a set of libraries for graphical output (https://qwt.sourceforge.io/) downloaded in MSYS. HOWEVER: we use a separate branch of this lib.
- CMAKE is part of the code development and compilation, it generates file for MINGW
- GIT: to download and manage the openLISEM code from github


-------------- step 1 ---------------

> Download MSYS2.0 

Open the MSYS command window and execute the following commands. 
(answer "y" when asked.)

update MSYS itself:
Pacman -Syu
The window may close, simply open it again

install the following base packages:
pacman -S base-devel git mercurial cvs wget p7zip
pacman -S perl ruby python mingw-w64-x86_64-toolchain

-install qt5 which is for now the version in which lisem is created:
pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-qt5 mingw-w64-x86_64-qt-creator 
-install openmp and gdal and qwt:
pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-openmp mingw-w64-x86_64-gdal mingw-w64-x86_64-qwt-qt5

note: we are not using this version of qwt but a chnged one, but install it anyway for the source code.

IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG YOU CAN UNINSTALL AND START AGAIN. 
BUT DELETE BY HAND THE MSYS64 FOLDER, THE UNINSTALL PROCESS DOES NOT CLEAN UP EVERYTHING! 

{NOTE: info on pacman options: https://devhints.io/pacman)

Add the minw location to the windows path (see e.g. here on how to do that: https://helpdeskgeek.com/windows-10/add-windows-path-environment-variable/):
c:\[your path]\msys64\mingw64 
c:\[your path]\msys64\mingw64\bin

restart your PC after this step!


-------------- step 2 ---------------

> get the GIT and CMAKE software
Install git latest version: https://git-scm.com/
Install cmake lastest version: https://cmake.org
If you want use Tortoise GIT for an easy integration of GIT commands into the winfows explorer: https://tortoisegit.org/

> Download the openLISEM code from github:
Register online at github.com
create an empty directory "lisem" for the code, e.g. c:/prgc/lisem
create an empty directory for the compiled executable (do not make it a subdirectory of lisem), e.g. c:/prgc/lisem-bin

> With the explorer go into the lisem directory and open a command prompt window (type CMD in to the address line):

type:
git clone https://github.com/vjetten/openlisem.git .
(do not forget the '.')

all openlisem code will be downloaded now

> read about GIT, for instance make a branch for yourself (e.g. "mylisem)
git branch mylisem
git checkout mylisem
Please do NOT merge your code with the remote repository!

-------------- step 3 ---------------

> generate the CMAKE files for MINGW to compile lisem

open cmake-gui (should be in your list of programmes after installation). 

In the interface, the first field  ("where is the source code") should point to the folder 'lisem' with the github code
the second field ("where to build the binaries") should point to the still empty folder 'lisem-bin'
press configure, choose "codeblocks - MingW makefiles" 
Red fields should appear without any warnings or errors (one field says "CMAKE_CODEBLOCKS_EXECUTABLE-NOTFOUND", ignore that)

-------------- step 4 ---------------

For openLISEM we use a special version of QWT which is provided on the github website of openlisem:
download qt-6.1-ma.zip from https://github.com/vjetten/openlisem/releases/tag/openLisem 
unzip this file in a folder of your choice, for instance in a folder near the openLISEM code

-------------- step 5 ---------------

> compile the code

Open Qtcreator (C:\[your path]\msys64\mingw64\bin\qtcreator.exe) and load the file "CMakeList.txt" in the folder 'lisem'
click on edit in the left bbar. You should now see the complete tree structure of the code. 
Because you have your own dirs for MINGW and QWT you have to tell the code wehre to find it:

find aplication.cmake under "CMake Modules" and change these lines too yoru own folder names:
IF(WIN32)
 SET(QWT_BUILD_DIR "c:/qt/qwt-6.1-ma") # <= give your won names here
 SET(GDAL_BUILD_DIR "c:/qt/msys64/mingw64")
ENDIF()

Click on Projects in the left bar and add '-j' to the "build steps" to speed up the compilation:
cmake.exe --build C:/prgc/lisem-msys --target all -j

You can now try to compile for the first time.

Currently this gives a lot of errors that are not related to the lisem code involving "stdlib.h" not found.
A workaround is to find where the errors originate, in "cstdlib" and "cmath" and change the line
#include_next <stdlib.h>
to
#include <stdlib.h>
You have to do this in 3 or 4 places. I could not find another way to do this. If you find why please contact me!

-------------- step 6 ---------------

Finally: you can run openLISEM from within qtcreator bt not outside as a stand alone version. 
The many libraries that lisem.exe needs are included in the release version of openLISME on github. 
Download the latest version and unzip it in the 'lisem-bin' folder.
You should now be able to compile and run openlisem 


best of luck!
