this file is a list of changes per major commit
231208 - v6.899-v6.94
- flowboundary crashed, fixed
-
230623 - v6.899
- fixing small bugs in channel side inflow from sat soil layer
- overall soil mass balance correction
- output to seperate files only from all points in outpoint.map.
230619 - v6.898
- merge GW flow into main branch: 3 type sof GW flow. Connection to channel baseflow revised
- side flow into channelfrom saturated soil (in advanced options)
230512 - v6.897
- merge user discharge input in main branch
- fix bug with infiltration continuing even when layer two is full with GW
230512 - v6.896
- User defined discharge input, e.g. from dam spill
- psi uwetting front is optional from user or calculated
230512 - v6.895
- Psi is set back to a psi for the wetting front, somewhere slightly more than the bubbling pressure, relations from rawls et al 1982
- All relations (field capacity, bubbling pressure) are now from Rawls 1982
- removed psi and psi calibration from interface
- added exceel sheets
- added new compilation text
230505 - v6.894
- Psi is now calculated from theta with brook-Corey, instead of input. Calibration remains
- Psi is also added to percolation and redistribution of water
- Redistribution is split in two function for 1 and 2 layers
- Increase infiltration depth is split into 2 function for 1 and 2 layers
230424 - v6.892-6.893
- Fixed bug causing profile to become saturated instantaneously because percolation from layer 1 to layer 2 saturates subsoil
- Rewriting of GW flow, LDD version and pressure version work now
- rewriting of void InfilEffectiveKsat
- added soilwidthDX to infil calculation
- replaced fill with Fill (parallel)
230412 - v6.891
- fixed bug open and closed boundary flow, to be further tested on different catchments
- fixed small bugs for reporting to files all output to files with clear separation of total outflow and channelhydrographs fopr water and sediment
- and reporting of units m3/s and l/s
230412 - v6.89
- redesigned GW flow completely, only two calib. paraters now, flow to the GW layer and GWflow to the channel
- added calibration factors for soildepth 1 and 2
- Interface works better with low resolutions screens
- erosion overland flow uses govers and harsine and rose
- included iterative version of connection between 2D flow and channel
- fixed bug in sediment in non-iterative connection of 2D flow and channel
version 6.887
- fixed sceen display of discharge, should not be cumulative
- fixed screen display of sediment load
version 6.885
- fixed screen display of discharge factor 1000!
230314 - v6.882-6.883
- fixed kin wave MB error (interception of houses)
- fixed erosion MB error (caused by cell_depositInfil(r,c))
- checked all erosion functions in Splash, 1D and 2D flow for consistency and logic
- kniown bug 1D2D flow (overflow channels) has mass balance errors in water and sediment, needs to be fixed or minimized
230123 - v6.881
- fixed major interface bug: factor 1000 in screen display of runoff! Factor is already done in Qoutput itself, does not need to be done in interface
221105 - v6.88
- Qmax in culverts better, Qmax does not have to appear in Kin Wave
- merged GW, pressure based and pref flow as in SWAT
- Ksat crust exponential decline from kssat1 to ksatcrust, porosity untouched for problems waterbalance(?)
- better behaviour culverts
- buildings can be added to the dem form a fraction onward (def 0.3)
- show runfile name on screen en save runfile to result dir, save all screens
- known bug: rainfall of multiple stations not working well!
221001 - v6.871
- blocked curve detach when starting run and show channel false qwhen changing culvert size
- changed order of default maps in 2nd screen, roads and hard surfaces now with buildings
- ChannelQ set to channelQn BEFORE erosion, should not be done
- potential bug: sediment in channel is routed with new alpha instead of old alpha
- changed detach of MPlot before runmodel, now in inimapplot
- op.culvertx and y no longer needed
- fixed aspect ratio of map and deleted resize option
221005 - v6.872
- experimental deep percoaltion from GW for continuous loss, not active
- on_toolButton_RainfallName_clicked() pointed to rainsatfile dir instead of rainfiledir
221006 - v6.873
- outlets and obspoints and drawing of rivers fixed now, no more sigdev
221009 - branch lisemgw1
- GW flow with upstream attempt
- changed threshold from exp(-6wh) to exp(-threshold*wh)
- changed culvert flow calculation to better increasing mannings n with water level, ChannelFlow(void), see excel
- fixed bug in calculation of avg soil moisture for display, function avgTheta()
- no channel infil in culverts
- set max V in channel to 20 m/s, was 100
- fixed bug in tree with map names, second tab, caused by changing positions
- add buildings to DEM options
- 2 options for GW flow and baseflow stationary. GWflow 2D can only be done if soil impermeable
