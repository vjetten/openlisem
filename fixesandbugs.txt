this file is a list of changes per major commit
230314 - v6.882-6.883
- fixed kin wave MB error (interception of houses)
- fixed erosion MB error (caused by cell_depositInfil(r,c))
- checked all erosion functions in Splash, 1D and 2D flow for consistency and logic
- kniown bug 1D2D flow (overflow channels) has mass balance errors in water and sediment, needs to be fixed or minimized
230123 - v6.881
- fixed major interface bug: factor 1000 in screen display of runoff! Factor is already done in Qoutput itself, does not need to be done in interface
221105 - v6.88
- Qmax in culverts better, Qmax does not have to appear in Kin Wave
221001 - v6.871
- blocked curve detach when starting run and show channel false qwhen changing culvert size
- changed order of default maps in 2nd screen, roads and hard surfaces now with buildings
- ChannelQ set to channelQn BEFORE erosion, should not be done
- potential bug: sediment in channel is routed with new alpha instead of old alpha
- changed detach of MPlot before runmodel, now in inimapplot
- op.culvertx and y no longer needed
- fixed aspect ratio of map and deleted resize option
221005 - v6.872
- experimental deep percoaltion from GW for continuous loss, not active
- on_toolButton_RainfallName_clicked() pointed to rainsatfile dir instead of rainfiledir
221006 - v6.873
- outlets and obspoints and drawing of rivers fixed now, no more sigdev
221009 - branch lisemgw1
- GW flow with upstream attempt
- changed threshold from exp(-6wh) to exp(-threshold*wh)
- changed culvert flow calculation to better increasing mannings n with water level, ChannelFlow(void), see excel
- fixed bug in calculation of avg soil moisture for display, function avgTheta()
- no channel infil in culverts
- set max V in channel to 20 m/s, was 100
- fixed bug in tree with map names, second tab, caused by changing positions
- add buildings to DEM options
- 2 options for GW flow and baseflow stationary. GWflow 2D can only be done if soil impermeable
221105 - v6.88
- merged GW, pressure based and pref flow as in SWAT
- Ksat crust exponential decline from kssat1 to ksatcrust, porosity untouched for problems waterbalance(?)
- better behaviour culverts
- buildings can be added to the dem form a fraction onward (def 0.3)
- show runfile name on screen en save runfile to result dir, save all screens
- known bug: rainfall of multiple stations not working well!
