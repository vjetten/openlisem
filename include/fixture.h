    @brief      A fixture performs necessary setup and cleanup for Lisem to run.

    Upon construction a fixture initializes the runtime environment for Lisem.
    At the moment this involves configuring the GDAL library.

    This class can also be used as a test fixture in unit tests that depend
    on the initializations.
