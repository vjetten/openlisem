/// Interception()
/// - interception seen as rigid storage SMax filling up and overflowing\n
/// - overflow flux is identical to rainfall flux in intensity\n
/// - SMax is the storage of the plants inside the gridcell, not the average storage of the gridcell\n
/// - so if a single tree inside a cell has an SMax of 2mm even if it covers 10%, the Smax of that cell is 2\n
/// - therefore the same goes for LAI: the LAI of the plants inside the gridcell\n
/// - this is also easier to observe. The LAI from a satellite image is the average LAI of a cell, must be divided by Cover
